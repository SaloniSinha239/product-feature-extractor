# ðŸ“± Product Feature Extractor using FLAN-T5

This project uses a few-shot prompting approach with the *FLAN-T5* model to extract key product features from smartphone reviews. It's designed to demonstrate how generative AI can be used for *text analysis, **feature extraction, and **automated insights* from customer feedback.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- *Input*: A list of smartphone reviews (text)
- *Output*: Extracted product features (e.g., battery life, camera quality, overheating)
- *Model*: google/flan-t5-base from Hugging Face
- *Platform*: Google Colab

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. A few-shot prompt is crafted with examples of reviews and their corresponding features.
2. Each review is passed through the FLAN-T5 model using this prompt.
3. The model returns a list of features mentioned in the review.
4. Results are saved to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.
